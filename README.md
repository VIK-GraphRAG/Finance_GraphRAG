>>>>> Project Concept

VIK AI is a **Graph-RAG based Financial Report Analyzer** designed to help users efficiently analyze large financial documents.  
The system combines **document retrieval** with **graph-based reasoning** to generate **accurate and explainable answers** from financial PDFs.

Unlike traditional AI tools that act as black boxes, VIK AI structures financial information into connected entities and relationships, enabling deeper insights and multi-document reasoning while running **locally for data privacy**.
