The company is working with multiple manufacturing partners including Foxconn and Wistron for supercomputer assembly in Texas, and Amkor and SPIL for packaging and testing operations in Arizona.[3] Notably, NVIDIA has begun producing Blackwell chips at TSMC's Phoenix, Arizona facility, marking the first time these critical AI chips are manufactured on U.S. soil.[1][4]\n\nDespite this diversification, TSMC remains central to NVIDIA's strategy. The two companies have a **three-decade partnership** and continue to collaborate on advancing manufacturing technology, including NVIDIA's computational lithography platform (cuLitho), which TSMC has integrated into production to accelerate chip development.[2] NVIDIA plans to produce up to half a trillion dollars of AI infrastructure in the United States within four years through partnerships with TSMC and other manufacturers, indicating that while NVIDIA is building redundancy, TSMC continues to be a critical partner rather than a replaceable supplier.[3]",

However, AMD's market share is expanding, particularly in inference workloads where it captures nearly 50% customer mindshare among companies focused on inference-only deployments[2].\n\n## Key Competitive Advantages\n\n**AMD's Strengths:**\n- **Cost-per-performance:** The MI350X offers 40% better token-per-dollar efficiency than NVIDIA's B200 Blackwell chips for inference workloads[1]\n- **Software maturity:** ROCm 7.2 has achieved \"functional parity\" with mainstream AI frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, reducing migration friction from CUDA[1]\n- **Memory architecture:** The Helios platform emphasizes high-bandwidth memory richness, with the MI400 series providing expanded key-value caches for low-latency inference[2]\n- **Open standards:** AMD's open-source ROCm stack appeals to customers seeking alternatives to NVIDIA's proprietary systems[3]\n\n**NVIDIA's Advantages:**\n- **Ecosystem depth:** Superior software maturity and established developer tools continue to drive adoption[4]\n- **Supply chain dominance:** NVIDIA will be TSMC's leading customer in 2026, contributing approximately 20% of TSMC's revenue versus AMD's less than half that amount[2]\n- **Broader platform reach:** Leadership extends beyond data centers into edge AI and autonomous vehicles[4]\n\n## Market Momentum\n\nAMD stock rose 77.3% in 2025, outpacing NVIDIA in the final quarter[6]. An analyst forecast predicts AMD's AI revenue will reach $14-15 billion in 2026 driven by MI355 and MI455 accelerator shipments[3]. Strategic endorsements from OpenAI, Luma AI, and others signal growing ecosystem confidence[3].\n\n## 2026 Outlook\n\nThe competitive landscape is shifting toward **inference workloads and agentic AI**, where AMD's cost advantages and memory-rich architectures are particularly valuable[1][5]. While NVIDIA maintains overall market leadership, AMD is positioned to capture increasing share in cost-sensitive segments and specialized applications[3].",

It also features denser backside bumps for better power delivery and signal integrity at high speeds.[2][3][5]\n- **Additional Features**: HBM4 adds support for decision feedback equalizer (DFE), more mode registers (MR0-MR19 vs. HBM3's fewer), and backwards compatibility with HBM3 controllers, unlike some claims of incompatibility with HBM3E.[4][5][8]\n\n| Feature              | HBM3                          | HBM4                          |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Interface Width** | 1024-bit[2][4]               | 2048-bit[2][3][4]            |\n| **Data Rate (Gb/s)**| Up to 6.4[1][4]              | Up to 8 (10 in prototypes)[3][4] |\n| **Bandwidth/Stack** | ~819 GB/s[1]                 | Up to 2 TB/s[1][2][4]        |\n| **Channels**        | 16[1][5]                     | 32[2][5]                     |\n| **Max Capacity/Stack** | 24-36 GB[1]                | 64 GB[1][4][6]               |\n| **Stack Height**    | Up to 16-high (~750 \u00b5m for 12-high)[3] | Up to 16-high (~950 \u00b5m)[3] |\n\nThese advancements address AI training bottlenecks like data movement for large models, with HBM4 standardized by JEDEC in April 2025 by Samsung, Micron, and SK hynix.[1][4] Note minor source conflicts on HBM3E compatibility, but HBM4 is confirmed compatible with HBM3 controllers.[4][8]",

Goldman Sachs predicts **82% growth** in HBM for custom ASIC-based AI chips, comprising one-third of the market. HBM3E will dominate (~two-thirds of shipments), fueled by NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra and ASICs from Google/AWS.[1]\n- **AI Accelerators**: TSMC forecasts **mid-to-high 50% CAGR** (e.g., 57.5%) for AI accelerators from 2024-2029, implying ~$98.5 billion in revenue by 2029 from a ~$10.2 billion 2024 base. This includes GPUs, XPUs, and networking chips, with hyperscalers like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft shifting to custom ASICs for training/inference efficiency.[2][3]\n- **Overall Semiconductor Market**: Revenues are projected at **~$975.5 billion**, led by logic and memory (both >30% YoY growth). AI infrastructure expands server DRAM/HBM capacity and enterprise SSDs, with HBM potentially surpassing 2024's total DRAM market by 2028.[1][2]\n- **Edge and On-Device AI**: Inference shifts to edge devices (AI PCs, smartphones, IoT) with **>26% CAGR** for on-device compute via NPUs, increasing memory needs (e.g., 16-32GB+ RAM in AI PCs).[2][4]\n\n### Supply Chain Dynamics\n- **Capacity Expansion**: TSMC targets 2nm nodes and **~100k+ CoWoS wafers/month** for AI backlogs; SK hynix leads HBM3E/HBM4 supply.[1][2]\n- **Challenges**: AI prioritizes high-margin HBM/DDR5, causing shortages in consumer DRAM/NAND (supply growth at 16-17% YoY vs. historical norms). This raises prices and risks derailing AI PC growth, with potential PC/smartphone market contraction up to 2.9% in downside scenarios.[4]\n\n### Analyst Consensus\nDeutsche Bank anticipates another solid year for AI stocks, reflecting sustained hyperscaler capex on specialized hardware despite electricity/cooling bottlenecks.[5] While optimistic on accelerators and memory, forecasts note diversification beyond GPUs and supply risks into 2027.[1][3][4]",
